title: CS 331
name: Data Structures and Algorithms
description: Implementation and application of the essential data structures used in computer science. Analysis of basic sorting and searching algorithms and their relationship to these data structures. Particular emphasis is given to the use of object-oriented design and data abstraction in the creation and application of data structures. (3-1-3)

    title: Discord
    description: While you are always welcome to email either myself of the TAs with questions, sometimes, for simple questions, it might be easier to just send a quick message that the TAs, myself, or even other students could answer. For this reason, I've also set up a Discord server this semester to allow for quicker, easier communication.

    title: Jupyter Notebooks
    description: Jupyter notebooks provide an in-browser Python development platform. This will make it eaiser to distribute and interact with code written during lecture. All lecture notes, demos, and assignments will be distributed as notebook files.

goals:
  - 'Design and implement data structures based on the following abstract data types: lists, stacks, queues, priority queues, sets, maps, trees.'
  - Understand which data structures to use, and how to apply them to a variety of problems.
  - Analyze the asymptotic runtime complexity of common search/sort algorithms, and others used in the implementation of data structures.
  - Design and implement recursive functions.
  - Understand the utility of object-orientation in the implementation of sophisticated data types and APIs.
  - Identify aspects in the design and implementation of data structures that play a role in secure computing.
  - Practice test-driven development.
outcomes:
  - Analyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions.
  - Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program?s discipline.
  - Apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing-based solutions.
assignments:
  - There will be approximately 12 machine problems assigned over the course of the semester. They will be accessed, completed, and submitted via the online development environment and learning platform Mimir. Machine problems are not equally weighted.
  - Each student starts the semester with a "late pool" of 7 days. Late days are automatically applied when machine problems are submitted late (though not after the last day of the semester). After the late day pool is exhausted, late assignments will not be accepted for credit.
quizzes:
  - Quizzes will be periodically released on Mimir to help students prepare for upcoming exams. Students may retake quizzes as often as they wish before the deadline, though scores will not be released until after the final submission date. Quizzes are equally weighted.
exams:
  - 'There will be three exams: two midterms and a final. All exams are nominally cumulative, though will generally focus on material not covered by preceding exam(s). Exams are equally weighted.'
  - At the instructor's discretion, scores for the second midterm and final exam may be used to replace earlier exam scores, if they show improvement.
